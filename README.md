## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or higher
- **Twenty CRM** instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- **Claude Desktop** or compatible MCP client

### Option 1: Install via npm (Recommended)

The easiest way to use this server is via npx:

1. **Get your Twenty CRM API key:**
   - Log in to your Twenty CRM instance
   - Navigate to **Settings → API & Webhooks** (under Developers)
   - Click **Generate API Key**
   - Copy the key

2. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

   Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "twenty-crm": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "twenty-crm-mcp-server"],
         "env": {
           "TWENTY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
           "TWENTY_BASE_URL": "https://api.twenty.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For self-hosted Twenty:**
   ```json
   "TWENTY_BASE_URL": "https://your-twenty-instance.com"
   ```

3. **Restart Claude Desktop**

### Option 2: Install from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/KonstiDoll/twenty-crm-mcp-server.git
   cd twenty-crm-mcp-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Get your Twenty CRM API key:**
   - Log in to your Twenty CRM instance
   - Navigate to **Settings → API & Webhooks** (under Developers)
   - Click **Generate API Key**
   - Copy the key

5. **Configure Claude Desktop:**

   Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
   **Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "twenty-crm": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/absolute/path/to/twenty-crm-mcp-server/dist/index.js"],
         "env": {
           "TWENTY_API_KEY": "your_api_key_here",
           "TWENTY_BASE_URL": "https://api.twenty.com"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **For self-hosted Twenty:**
   ```json
   "TWENTY_BASE_URL": "https://your-twenty-instance.com"
   ```

### Automatic Environment Loading (.env)

The server now loads environment variables from `.env.local` (preferred) and `.env` automatically on startup—no more manual `export` before launching Mist/Claude.

1. Create a `.env.local` file in the project root (same folder as `package.json`).
2. Add any sensitive or machine-specific values:

  ```bash
  TWENTY_API_KEY=sk_live_...
  TWENTY_BASE_URL=https://app.twenty.com
  ATTACHMENT_LOCAL_ROOT=/Volumes/4TB/Twenty/twenty/attachments/workspace-10cf6632-1bb4-439a-acdb-bd3011a1435e/attachment
  ```

3. Restart your MCP client (Mist/Claude). The loader will pull these values into `process.env` before the server registers its tools, so attachment previews and API calls work without re-exporting paths.

> `.env.local` stays git-ignored; use `.env` only for default values you’re comfortable sharing with collaborators.

6. **Restart Claude Desktop**

## 📋 Understanding Composite Fields

Twenty CRM uses **composite fields** for related data. This server handles them automatically:

### Name Composite
```javascript
name: {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe"
}
```

### Emails Composite
```javascript
emails: {
  primaryEmail: "john@example.com",
  additionalEmails: ["john.doe@gmail.com"]
}
```

### Phones Composite
```javascript
phones: {
  primaryPhoneNumber: "5551234567",
  primaryPhoneCountryCode: "US",
  primaryPhoneCallingCode: "+1",
  additionalPhones: []
}
```

### Address Composite
```javascript
address: {
  addressStreet1: "123 Main St",
  addressStreet2: "Suite 100",
  addressCity: "San Francisco",
  addressPostcode: "94102",
  addressState: "CA",
  addressCountry: "United States"
}
```

### Link Composite (LinkedIn, X, Domain)
```javascript
linkedinLink: {
  primaryLinkUrl: "https://linkedin.com/in/user",
  secondaryLinks: []
}
```

### Currency Composite (ARR)
```javascript
annualRecurringRevenue: {
  amountMicros: 5000000000000,  // $5M stored as micros
  currencyCode: "USD"
}
```

**Note:** You provide simple values (e.g., `email: "john@example.com"`), and the server automatically structures them correctly for Twenty's API.

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Why GraphQL?

This server uses **GraphQL** instead of REST because:

1. **Better for nested objects** - Twenty uses many composite fields
2. **Type safety** - GraphQL schema validation catches errors early
3. **Flexible queries** - Request exactly the fields you need
4. **Clear error messages** - Easier debugging
5. **Future-proof** - Easy to extend with new fields

### Technical Stack

- **MCP SDK** - [@modelcontextprotocol/sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/sdk)
- **GraphQL** - Direct integration with Twenty's GraphQL API
- **Node.js** - ES Modules, async/await
- **TypeScript** - Full type safety and IDE support
- **Vitest** - Fast unit testing with 71%+ code coverage
- **Twenty CRM** - Open-source CRM platform

## 🧪 Development & Testing

### TypeScript Support

The server is written in **TypeScript** with comprehensive type definitions for:

- **All API operations** - Person and Company CRUD operations
- **GraphQL requests** - Full typing for queries and mutations
- **Composite fields** - Type-safe nested objects
- **MCP protocol** - Integration with the SDK's type system

**Benefits:**
- 🔒 Type-safe development with autocompletion
- 🐛 Catch errors at compile-time
- 📖 Self-documenting code with IntelliSense
- 🔄 Easy refactoring with confidence

### Building from Source

```bash
# Build the TypeScript code
npm run build

# Start the compiled server
npm start

# Development mode with auto-reload
npm run dev

# Type-check without building
npm run type-check
```

### Running Tests

The project includes **comprehensive unit tests** with 71%+ code coverage:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ GraphQL request handling
- ✅ All Person operations (create, get, list, update)
- ✅ All Company operations (create, get, list, update)
- ✅ All Opportunity operations (create, get, list, update)
- ✅ All Task operations (create, get, list, update)
- ✅ All Note operations (create, get, list, update)
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Composite field transformations (name, emails, phones, address, bodyV2)
- ✅ Currency conversion (ARR and opportunity amounts to micros)

### Configuration Files

**TypeScript:**
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript compiler configuration
- `src/index.ts` - Main server implementation

**Testing:**
- `vitest.config.ts` - Test configuration
- `src/index.test.ts` - Comprehensive test suite

**Build Output:**
- `dist/` - Compiled JavaScript and type definitions
- `coverage/` - Test coverage reports

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

**Error: GraphQL request failed (404)**

- Check `TWENTY_BASE_URL` is correct
- Self-hosted: Use your full domain (e.g., `https://twenty.company.com`)
- Cloud: Use `https://api.twenty.com`
- GraphQL endpoint is automatically set to `${TWENTY_BASE_URL}/graphql`

**Error: GraphQL request failed (401) or (403)**

- Verify API key is correct
- Check API key has proper permissions in Twenty
- Generate a new API key in Settings → API & Webhooks

### Field Validation Errors

**Error: `Field 'xyz' expected type 'ABC'`**

The server handles field transformations automatically. If you see validation errors:

1. Check the field name matches the API Reference
2. Ensure correct data types (string, number, boolean)
3. Review the GraphQL error message for specifics
4. Check the Examples section for correct usage

### Records Not Appearing

**Symptoms:** No error but record doesn't appear in Twenty UI

**Debug Steps:**

1. Check the response - does it include an `id`?
2. Try fetching by ID: `"Get person with ID xyz"`
3. Refresh the Twenty CRM UI
4. Check Claude Desktop logs for hidden errors

## 🔄 Common Workflows

### Onboarding New Clients

```
1. "Create a company called NewCo with domain newco.com"
2. "Create a person named John Smith, email john@newco.com, works at NewCo as CTO"
3. "Update NewCo's details: 10 employees, ARR $250k, mark as ideal customer profile"
```

### Lead Management

```
1. "List all ideal customer profile companies"
2. "Find all contacts at [company name]"
3. "Update [person] with note about last call"
```

### Data Enrichment

```
1. "List people without LinkedIn profiles"
2. "Update [person] LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/username"
3. "List companies missing employee count"
```
